Portfolio site built using Next.js. I adapted this [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) to use the new App Router introduced in Next.js 13. I really liked the strategy introduced in the tutorial for handling content in a series of markdown files, and decided to continue using that. CSS layout is all vanilla. no frameworks or libraries.
