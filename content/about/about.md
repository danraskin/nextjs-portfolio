Hi! On this corner of the internet, I'm Full-Stack Software Engineer. I've been doing this 2022, love doing it, and am hoping to make this into a career. Above all, I'm looking for great collaborators, interesting challenges, and projects with real impacts.

I also record and perform electronic music, co-host and produce a literature and history podcast. Less frequently, I write fiction and produce visual art.
