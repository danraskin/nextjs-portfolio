### Hi! My name is Dan Raskin. Here's the professional section of my about page:

I am Full-Stack Software Engineer with experience designing, building, and supporting custom business applications. In addition to software product development, I am a skilled project manager, strong communicator across teams and audieces, and creative problem-solver. I'm looking for great collaborators, interesting challenges, and projects with real impacts.

Languages
- Javascript
- Python

Technologies and Frameworks
- Node.js
- React
- PostgreSQL
- OAuth2.0
- Next.js
- Express.js
- Heroku
- Git

### Here's the personality section:

For a sampling of my creative pursuits, I record and perform electronic music, and co-host a literature and history [podcast](https://unseenbookclub.buzzsprout.com/). Less frequently, I write fiction and produce visual art. In my estimation, these endeavors tend rank low- to- medium on the technology scale but high- to- very- high on the interesting, collaborative challenges scale.
